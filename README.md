# Android-Quickstart
Opinionated project template for Android projects

Steps:
1. Copy base project template to new directory
2. Render templates
3. Rename packages appropriately

Note that I chose to use and extension to mark template files and ``.j2`` is the extension I've chosen. Jinja doesn't require any sort of extension to operate, but it makes it easier to filter files that need to be rendered by Jinja.
